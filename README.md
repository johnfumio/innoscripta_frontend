1. Structure
    - Pages

        We have 5 different pages here. - Login, Register, Feed, Home, Setting

        These pages are the elements for showing one page in react app. Storage management and API calls are handled  in this level.
    - Components

        Components are the pure elements that showing the data with props without storage or api calls.

    Implemented the auth storage management part for storing auth info. - token, user name, user Id, etc

3. UI/UX design

    I used React Bootstrap for styling the component. Used Grid system and flexbox for layouts in several pages.
